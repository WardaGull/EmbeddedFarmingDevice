# Embedded Farming Device

This project aims to provide farmers with real-time information about their land and crops by using an embedded device that integrates pH, temperature, and soil moisture sensors with an Arduino microcontroller. The device sends data to a web interface, which displays the information in an easy-to-use format.

## Hardware Components

- Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
- pH sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Soil moisture sensor

## Software Components

- Arduino IDE
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web interface
- PHP for server-side scripting
- SQL database for storing data

## Installation

To set up the embedded farming device, follow these steps:

1. Connect the pH sensor, temperature sensor, and soil moisture sensor to the Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller.
2. Connect the wifi module to the arduino UNO.
3. Upload the Arduino code provided in this repository to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.
4. Set up a server to host the web interface and create a SQL database to store data. You can use a local or remote server.
5. Upload the web code provided in this repository to the server.
6. Update the database credentials in the PHP scripts to match your server configuration.

*Note:* This code is still incomplete but it's functional for the specific required task.

## Usage

Once the device and web interface are set up, you can use the embedded farming device to monitor your land and crops. The pH sensor, temperature sensor, and soil moisture sensor will continuously send data to the microcontroller, which will then send the data to the web interface. You can view the data in real-time on the web interface, and use it to make informed decisions about planting, irrigation, and fertilization.
